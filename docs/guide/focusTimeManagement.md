# Focus Time Manager.

## Description

The focusTimeManager function assists users in managing focused work sessions throughout their day. It provides a schedule with alternating focus and break sessions, which is particularly useful for productivity techniques like the Pomodoro Technique.

## Note:

It is similar to [Mental Health Manager](./mentalHealth.md) but it is more focused on work sessions.

## Usage

```javascript
import { focusTimeManager } from 'world-clockify';

const preference = {
  workStartTime: '09:00',
  workEndTime: '17:00',
  preferredTimeZone: 'America/New_York',
  focusDuration: 50,
  shortBreakDuration: 10,
};

const schedule = focusTimeManager(preference);

console.log(schedule);
```

## Expected Output

```bash
  {
   focusSessions: [
     { start: '09:00 am', end: '09:50 am' },
     { start: '10:00 am', end: '10:50 am' },
     ...
   ],
   reminders: ['Time to focus!', 'Take a short break!', 'Focus time starts again soon!']
 }

```

## Parameters

- focusUserPreferences(object): User inputs.

## Returns

- (object): As a result.
