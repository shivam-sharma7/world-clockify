Let’s explore why a user might prefer to use the API endpoints instead of installing your world-clockify NPM package. While both options offer timezone and date manipulation features, there are several distinct use cases where the API might be a better fit:

## Note

Our base URl for the API is `https://world-clockify-api.onrender.com/api/v1` and all the endpoints are relative to this base URL.

## 1. Serverless/Lightweight Client Applications

When to Use the API: For applications that run in environments where installing Node.js packages is not feasible, such as serverless environments (AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers), lightweight web applications, or frontend-only applications.
Why: The API allows developers to make simple HTTP requests from the client-side (browser) without bundling additional dependencies.

- Example: A static website that needs to display current times across various timezones but wants to avoid increasing the bundle size by installing the world-clockify package.

## 2. Cross-Platform & Language-Agnostic Integration

When to Use the API: Developers working in languages other than JavaScript/TypeScript (e.g., Python, Ruby, Java) who need timezone and date operations.
Why: The API can be called from any environment that supports HTTP requests, making it accessible across different platforms and programming languages.
Example: A Python backend or mobile app in Swift/Java that needs to calculate time differences but can't directly use the NPM package.

## 3. Low-Resource or Minimal Infrastructure

When to Use the API: Developers who are working on a project that doesn’t require full control over the logic or heavy infrastructure (e.g., serverless apps or lightweight microservices).
Why: By using the API, developers can delegate the heavy lifting of timezone management to your backend, reducing local resource consumption (e.g., memory, CPU).

- Example: A small web application that doesn’t want to maintain complex time zone logic and prefers to make API calls for time zone conversions or current time lookups.

## 4. Zero Maintenance / No Updates

When to Use the API: Projects that prioritize ease of maintenance and don't want to manage or update an NPM package.
Why: The API allows developers to simply consume the service without worrying about updating the package when new features or bug fixes are released.

- Example: A project where the developer prefers that someone else maintains the service and they don’t need to worry about versioning or dependencies.

## 5. Quick Prototyping or Third-Party Integrations

When to Use the API: When developers are building a quick prototype or integrating a third-party tool and don't want to install additional dependencies.
Why: The API is quick and easy to consume for rapid development without the overhead of package management.
Example: A demo or proof-of-concept web app that needs quick timezone conversions but doesn’t want to manage NPM dependencies.

## 6. Centralized Logic / Single Point of Control

When to Use the API: For organizations or teams that want centralized control over timezone logic.
Why: By using the API, an organization can ensure that all clients—mobile apps, web apps, microservices—use the same consistent logic without having to distribute the NPM package across multiple platforms.
